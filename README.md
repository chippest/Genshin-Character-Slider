# GENSHIN CHARACTER SLIDER

- use scroll wheel to switch between characters
- can use the slider at the right side to switch character as well
- click on the elements at the top right to select the element and show its characters
- if the slider is already at the top or bottom, and you scroll even further, then it will change to the next element and show its characters

## The images might take some time to load when you first switch to a character!!
